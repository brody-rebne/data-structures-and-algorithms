# FizzBuzz Tree

### Code

https://github.com/brody-rebne/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/code-challenges/FizzBuzzTree/FizzBuzzTree

### Problem Domain

Create a method called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument. Create a new tree with identical structure as the original but with the values changed as follows:
- Replace value with “Fizz” if it can be divided by 3.
- Replace value with “Buzz” if it can be divided by 5.
- Replace value with “FizzBuzz” if it can be divided by 3 and 5.
- Turn the number into a string if it cannot be divided by 3 or 5.

Then return the new tree.

Do not use any built-in methods.

### Expected Input/Output

Input: a tree of int Nodes

Output: a tree of string Nodes with values replaced to reflect FizzBuzz status.

### Big O

Time: O(d) where d is the number of nodes in the tree
Space: O(n)
